            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <opener>Humbly sheweth,</opener>
            <p>THAT whereas I having given in a Petition the other day, Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting, That by the claim of Right it is provided, That all Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feitures, Fines, Pursuits, Persecutions, and Rigorous Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, in the time of the late Reigns be considered, and the Parties leised be redressed, and that I was a great Sufferer in the late Times; My Estate by Rigorous Exactions being absolutely Ruined, and that I had several Rights belonging to me; Which I was in hazard to loose by Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription, albeit for many years I was not <hi>Valens agere:</hi> and therefore crav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, That your Grace and Lordships, may consider my Losses and Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and fall upon some way how I might be effectually repaired, And that the thirteen years I lay under these Rigorous Executions, and Distress might be deduced from the years of Prescription; which Petition your Grace and Lordships appointed to ly upon the Table, because I did not condescend in my Petition, upon the Rights that are alleadged to be prescrived. And now for the Parliaments clearing what is the Right alledged to be prescrived, as to which I crave the saids years to be deduced, I condescend that it was a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge, and a Renounciation granted be <hi>John Hamiltoun</hi> of <hi>Kinkel</hi> my Brother of an woodset of 11200 Merks upon the Lands of <hi>Kenaldie,</hi> which my said Brother granted on Death-bed in favours of <hi>Sohn Aytoun</hi> of <hi>Kenaldie,</hi> and that without any onerous cause; Which Discharge and Renounciation was grant-in the year 1644, and I having intented a Reduction thereof upon the head of Death-bed in <hi>June</hi> 1694, upon which, the Lords having given a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission for examining of witnesses; The reason of Death-bed is clearly proven: So that undoubtedly the said Discharge and Renounciation will reduce, and the Defender can have no Defence, except that he pretends pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription, and there being about 50 years or thereby, betwixt the granting of the said Renounciation, and my raising a Reduction, of which 50 years, there is to be deduced the time from the first of <hi>November</hi> 1688, to the 15 of <hi>October</hi> 1689 by the late Act of Parliament in the year 1690, which will be near a year, and the eight year or thereby, more should be deduced upon the account of my Minority, so that I will want about a year or thereby to bring my action of Reduction within the years of prescription, I having been Born in the year 1631; But because it will not be possible to get an extract of my Baptism, the Session Books of the Kirk of <hi>Duninno,</hi> being burnt when the Readers house there was burned; And it will be most difficult to get Witnesses to prove my age, after so long a time. It is just and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:175253:2"/> reasonable, That seing by the Act of Parliament anent the Fines and Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feitures, persons that had suffered in the late times by forefeitures, denounci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations, or otherwayes, shall not be prejudged by shorter prescriptions; I should have the benefite of the said Act extended to me; seeing I was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced and inter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>d in the year 1675, for Church irregularities, &amp; others mentioned in the said Act; And did ly under the samen, untill the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Revolution, for the space of 13 years, during which time; Likewise, I was three years under an Inditement of Treason, and eighteen Moneths in prison; As also, dureing that time, there being a Garison put into my house, who did detain all my Writes and Papers. And after the Garison went out of my house, my Writes were all s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>tered here and there; And it was a long time before I got them together, and so soon as I got them I intented the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction, by which it is evident, that for the said thirteen years I was not <hi>valens agere;</hi> But least the Lords of Session should make any scruple, as to the deducing of these years, it is propper to the High Court of Parliament to clear the samen.</p>
            <p>It is therefore humbly craved, That your Grace, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Estates of Parliament, may be pleased to take the Pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>sses to your Consideration; And subduce these thirteen years, from the years of Prescription of the foresaid Right, Especially seeing, that dureing that time I was intercommuned, no Lawyer would Advise with me, Nor durst any Writer to the Signet raise a Summonds at my instance, that I might interrupt the Prescription; As also, to be graciously pleased to fall u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon some effectuall way, that I may be Repaired of my great Loses. <hi>And Your Petitioner shall ever pray, &amp;c.</hi>
